Mainly expecting -How we can use kafka in cloud in asyncronous communication specifically between the pods r b/w the services??
knowledge & filtering the data from topic using kafka steams
how to handle out of memory exceptions in streams

Day1 Agenda:
Message Queue
Kafka Vs Rabbitmq
Kafka Terminologies
Kafka Architecture
Kafka Topics, Partitions
Cli Producer, Consumer


Kafka: Opensource Message queue built from ground up for solving the scaling problem of message queue
Enterprise ready: Java, massively parallel distributed architecture, very high scalability, high fault tolerance

List of message: Activemq, Rabbitmq, Zmq, Ibm MQ, Kafka, Cloud, etc
Advantages of Kafka:
	1. Distributed: Scalability & Fault tolerance
	2. Microservices: Exactly once delivery per consumer Group


Terminologies:
	1. Applications writing data into a queue is called Publisher
	2. Applications reading data from a queue is called Subscriber
	3. Messages are stored in a server application called Broker
	4. Every record of data is called a message
	5. Messages are stored in a sequence inside a Queue
	6. Every message is tracked using a unique per message number called offset
	7. This communication with queue is called PubSub model

Push Model		-> Rabbimq


Break from 11.51 to 12.06 PM!

Message Ordering:
	Key based routing
	Within Partition message ordering is guarenteed

Kafka Assigns every partition to one consumer in a consumer group

Kafka Vs Rabbitmq

Kafka Terminologies

Terminology						Rabbitmq		kafka
Queue							Queue			Topic
App writing data into queue		Publisher		Producer
App Reading data from queue		Subscriber		Consumer
Model							PubSub 			Producer-Consumer
Message Delivery				Push mechanism	Pull Mechanism
Offset management				Broker			Consumer
														Topics->Partitions, Replication


Topics->Partitions, Replication
Consumer Group, Consumer Group Balancing

Kafka runs on port 9092		-> bootstrap-server => 9092 port
