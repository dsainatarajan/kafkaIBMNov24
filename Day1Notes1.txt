Day1 Agenda:
Message Queue
Kafka Vs Rabbitmq
Kafka Terminologies
Kafka Architecture
Kafka Topics, Partitions
Cli Producer, Consumer

https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/amqp-concepts -> Rabbitmq, exchange & queue

Kafka: Opensource Message queue built from ground up for solving the scaling problem of message queue
Enterprise ready: Java, massively parallel distributed architecture, very high scalability, high fault tolerance
Low latency, high throughput

List of message: Activemq, Rabbitmq, Zmq, Ibm MQ, Kafka, Cloud, etc
Advantages of Kafka:
	1. Distributed: Scalability & Fault tolerance
	2. Microservices: Exactly once delivery per consumer Group


Terminologies:
	1. Applications writing data into a queue is called Publisher
	2. Applications reading data from a queue is called Subscriber
	3. Messages are stored in a server application called Broker
	4. Every record of data is called a message
	5. Messages are stored in a sequence inside a Queue
	6. Every message is tracked using a unique per message number called offset
	7. This communication with queue is called PubSub model

Push Model		-> Rabbimq


Break from 11.35 to 11.50 PM!

Message Ordering:
	Key based routing
	Within Partition message ordering is guarenteed

Kafka Assigns every partition to one consumer in a consumer group

Kafka Vs Rabbitmq

Kafka runs on port 9092		-> bootstrap-server => 9092 port
